# Głusza

🎛️ Indie tech lab for music-focused tools.  
🛠️ Run by @barmiedev — shipped with care, vision, and a little noise.  

We build tools that help artists, not just users.  
Everything here is open, practical, and raw — no fluff, no VC buzzwords.  

### 🌲 What’s “Głusza”?

> **Głusza** *(pronounced: **GWOO-shah**)* — Polish for “a remote, wild place.”  
> A space to build without noise. Tools for artists, from the creative wilderness.

A solo creative studio crafting software for the people behind the music — artists, managers, DIYers, rebels.

### Mission:
Build thoughtful tools for the backstage of the music world.  
Make software that respects the craft, chaos, and complexity of making music today.
